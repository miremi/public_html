                    <h2>REBOUND - Film Project</h2>
                    <h3> Project Description</h3>
                    <h3>Project Schedule</h3>
                    <p>This project was created in a team of 5. The genre we wanted our film to fall in was sci-fi. We
                        started
                        with a basic idea of an android working as a house care assistant trying to take care of their
                        heartbroken owner.

                        I was in charge of colour correcting the scenes we filmed and creating our presentation slides.
                        Discussing as a team, we wrote out a script and planned our schedule and roles. We had around 2
                        months
                        to plan, shoot and edit everything. This required us to make decisions efficiently and to solve
                        any
                        problems that occurred, occasionally compromising due to conflicting ideas or time restraints.
                        We listed out the equipment that we needed to book and what days we would visit the filming
                        site.
                        Occasionally, group members would be absent for part of the days that we were on set, so we
                        planned
                        out
                        what could be done with the members that were present.</p>
                    <h3>Shot List</h3>
                    <p>After figuring out our characters and script, we created our shot list. We divided up the shots
                        by
                        colouring coding based on what could be done in the same lighting and camera setup.</p>

                    <h3>Shot Setup</h3>
                    <p>While our scenes were mainly interior shots, we still wanted to make use of natural light. After
                        the
                        sun set, we had to recreate natural lighting with a light kit and then colour correct in After
                        Effects.
                        Starting camera and light positions were planned and changed on set if needed.</p>
